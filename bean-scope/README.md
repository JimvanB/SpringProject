# beanscope

There are two mean bean-scopes. This refers to what happens when you call the getBean method.

The first = Singleton. Everytime you say getBean("triangle"); it will return the same triangle object.
The second = Prototype, in which a new bean is created with every request or reference

Thus, with prototype, multiple instances of a bean can be created.
